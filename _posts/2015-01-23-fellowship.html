					<h3>SCHOOL OF DATA FELLOWSHIP</h3>
		    		<p>We started the Fellowship programme in a pilot in 2013, as a response to this question: how to ensure sustainable, long term impact if School of Data trainers are only present on the ground for short periods of time?

					Answer: Long term engagement, from people who are already in those communities. 
					</p>

					<p>The Fellowship programme started with the aim of recruiting and training the next generation of community leaders and data trainers, so that they could go on to provide long term support within their communities, and train others to do the same.</p>

					<p>We opened a call for fellows in May this year, and the fellows began their 6-month engagement with us by joining us at the Summer Camp in July. Somehow, the fellowship has already come to an end - but watch this space for news of the next round, which will be launching soon!</p>

				<!-- 	<p>Concrete activities of the 6 month fellowship programme include: 
					<p>guided and independent online and offline skillshares and trainings, aimed to develop data and leadership skills</p>
									<p>individual mentoring and coaching</p>
									<li>an appropriate stipend equivalent to a part time role</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Participation in the annual School of Data Summer Camp</li>
							<li>Participation in activities within a growing community of School of Data practitioners to ensure continuous exchange of resources, knowledge and best practices</li>
							<li>Training and coaching of the fellow in participatory event management, storytelling, public speaking, impact assessment etc;</li>
							<li>Opportunities for paid work - Often training opportunities arise in the countries where the fellows are based. After their fellowship, they will be offered the opportunity for paid work as a trainer. The School of Data have worked regularly with senior fellows Ketty Adoch, Ali Rebaie and Tarek Amr on this basis.</li>
							<li>Potential work with one or more local civil society organisations to develop data driven campaigns and research.</li>
