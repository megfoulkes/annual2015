					<h3>SCHOOL OF DATA FELLOWSHIP</h3>
		    		<p>We started the Fellowship programme in a pilot in 2013, as a response to this question: how to ensure sustainable, long term impact if School of Data trainers are only present on the ground for short periods of time?

					Answer: Long term engagement, from people who are already in those communities. 
					</p>

					<p>The Fellowship programme started with the aim of recruiting and training the next generation of community leaders and data trainers, so that they could go on to provide long term support within their communities, and train others to do the same.</p>

					<p>We opened a call for fellows in May this year, and the fellows began their 6-month engagement with us by joining us at the Summer Camp in July. Somehow, the fellowship has already come to an end - but watch this space for news of the next round, which will be launching soon!</p>

				<!-- 	<p>Concrete activities of the 6 month fellowship programme include: 
					<p>guided and independent online and offline skillshares and trainings, aimed to develop data and leadership skills</p>
									<p>individual mentoring and coaching</p>
									<li>an appropriate stipend equivalent to a part time role</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Participation in the annual School of Data Summer Camp</li>
							<li>Participation in activities within a growing community of School of Data practitioners to ensure continuous exchange of resources, knowledge and best practices</li>
							<li>Training and coaching of the fellow in participatory event management, storytelling, public speaking, impact assessment etc;</li>
							<li>Opportunities for paid work - Often training opportunities arise in the countries where the fellows are based. After their fellowship, they will be offered the opportunity for paid work as a trainer. The School of Data have worked regularly with senior fellows Ketty Adoch, Ali Rebaie and Tarek Amr on this basis.</li>
							<li>Potential work with one or more local civil society organisations to develop data driven campaigns and research.</li>
						</ul>

		        <p>“Basic understanding of how to use spreadsheets for data management and maintenance is largely lacking in Indian non-profits. I've found that working with people on simple things like how to use spreadsheets effectively can completely transform their relationship with data."</p>

I realised that Mexico is the leader in lots of things in Central America- but that we need to support other countries across Central America more. Being a School of Data fellow, and having the institutional support and the brand behind me has given me lots of opportunities; it has meant that people are more interested in what I'm doing"</p>

Also, equally important, is to communicate, in simple and clear means, that data back to the affected community, and thus create a feedback loop."</p>

I also enjoy learning about the experiences of different fellows. Each trip I've done has taught me so much. I feel like being a fellow, we're doing good things; teaching data skills like this is a form of activism – we’re getting people involved in political processes."</p>

				education agencies from the government of Tanzania. Despite these agencies having to deal with data of a similar nature, it is very rare to find them talking together about data - naturally, this causes a lot of duplication in their work. This workshop provided that rare moment for those agencies to talk about how to improve and harmonize their datasets  and also how to make sure their datasets conform to open data standards, making easy to share  data not only across agencies, but also to the wider public."</p>

				<h5>On her proudest moment so far:<br><br></h5>
					<p>"I always felt that Open Data was only for those who had great technical skills and that it was something I could never do. It has been half a year since I first attended an OKFworkshop and now I've conducted one along with my mentor. It's unbelievable! What's even greater is that all of this happened with the support of an open global community - where people were just happy to help and collaborate online. I didn't need a special master's degree or whatever to learn something. I found that all the things I wanted to learn more about were already written in a shared document or captured in a video skillshare. If not, all I had to do was ask. "</p>
