					<h3>SCHOOL OF DATA FELLOWSHIP</h3>
		    		<p>We started the Fellowship programme in a pilot in 2013, as a response to this question: how to ensure sustainable, long term impact if School of Data trainers are only present on the ground for short periods of time?

					Answer: Long term engagement, from people who are already in those communities. 
					</p>

					<p>The Fellowship programme started with the aim of recruiting and training the next generation of community leaders and data trainers, so that they could go on to provide long term support within their communities, and train others to do the same.</p>

					<p>We opened a call for fellows in May this year, and the fellows began their 6-month engagement with us by joining us at the Summer Camp in July. Somehow, the fellowship has already come to an end - but watch this space for news of the next round, which will be launching soon!</p>

				<!-- 	<p>Concrete activities of the 6 month fellowship programme include: 
					<p>guided and independent online and offline skillshares and trainings, aimed to develop data and leadership skills</p>
									<p>individual mentoring and coaching</p>
									<li>an appropriate stipend equivalent to a part time role</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Participation in the annual School of Data Summer Camp</li>
							<li>Participation in activities within a growing community of School of Data practitioners to ensure continuous exchange of resources, knowledge and best practices</li>
							<li>Training and coaching of the fellow in participatory event management, storytelling, public speaking, impact assessment etc;</li>
							<li>Opportunities for paid work - Often training opportunities arise in the countries where the fellows are based. After their fellowship, they will be offered the opportunity for paid work as a trainer. The School of Data have worked regularly with senior fellows Ketty Adoch, Ali Rebaie and Tarek Amr on this basis.</li>
							<li>Potential work with one or more local civil society organisations to develop data driven campaigns and research.</li>

		        <p>“Basic understanding of how to use spreadsheets for data management and maintenance is largely lacking in Indian non-profits. I've found that working with people on simple things like how to use spreadsheets effectively can completely transform their relationship with data."</p>

		        <p>"Together with SocialTIC, I carried out workshops in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. I realised that Mexico is the leader in lots of things in Central America- but that we need to support other countries across Central America more. Being a School of Data fellow, and having the institutional support and the brand behind me has given me lots of opportunities; it has meant that people are more interested in what I'm doing"</p>

I believe that the ability to present information in an inspiring and engaging manner is vital".</p>

		        <p>"Over the past few months, I’ve been working with <a href="http://publishwhatyoupay.org">Publish What You Pay</a> here in Indonesia. After just a few of trainings, I was so happy to see that they created, and published, their own visualisations with their own data -- without any help from me!"</p>

		        <p>"The concept of Open Data is still very fresh among Macedonians. Citizens, CSOs and activists are just beginning to realise the power hidden in data. They are beginning to sense that there is potential for them to use open data to support their causes, but in many cases they still don’t understand the value of open data, how to advocate for it, how to find it and most importantly - how to use it!”</p>

		        <p>"I have found through working on local campaigns that for open data to be successful one has to identify a ‘champion’, for example, someone in the government, who is interested in affected community. Also, equally important, is to communicate, in simple and clear means, that data back to the affected community, and thus create a feedback loop."</p>
