            <p>Q. What do you get when you mix 47 international data experts, 4000 post-it notes, a villa in Potsdam, lots of fresh air and sunshine?</p>
            
            <p>A. An incredible insight into the hidden talents of your chosen trainers, detailed plans and a buzz from new friendships which fuels a 6 month long fellowship.</p>

            <p>The <strong>School of Data Summer Camp</strong> was held on July 18 – 21, 2014 at Villa Adlon in Potsdam, Germany as the kickoff event to our international fellowship programme. School of Data partners, network leaders, fellows, special guests and staff focussed individual and community growth with through an intense 4-day programme of participatory activities. Participants honed their facilitation skills and learned the fun, hands-on School of Data way of doing things, shared their own training and data storytelling tips and tricks, and helped lay excellent foundations for the community to interact and grow.</p>
