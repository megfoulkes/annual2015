          <h3>ESCUELA DE DATOS</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
            <p>2014 was an exciting year for <a href="http://escueladedatos.org">Escuela de Datos</a>: 3 big events (AbreLatam in Mexico, the Data Journalism Sessions in Spain, and the OGP meeting in Costa Rica); over 30 data trainings all over Latin America, and several events to keep this community growing in size and strength.</p>

            <p>This year also saw the addition of two fellows to the Escuela de Datos family: Antonio Cucho, the young man behind the Open Data community in Peru (and who is heavily involved in Ojo Público, a promising data journalism project); and Rubén Moya, a Mexican computer scientist that found his calling as a data trainer, and in helping organizations seize the power of data.</p>

          <p>This year, the <a href="http://okfn.es/">group in Spain</a> organised activities primarily in Madrid and Barcelona in a mix of ofline events and e-learning workshops. They held monthly sessions at <a href="http://medialab-prado.es/article/periodismo_de_datos_-_grupo_de_trabajo">Medialab-Prado Madrid</a> and <a href="http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/category/proj/periodismo-datos/">CCCB Barcelona</a> made up with free workshops, with all of the talks streamed and/or recorded.</p>

          <p>This year, they also held the three day long <a href="http://periodismodatos.okfn.es/">Annual Conference on Data Journalism and Open Data</a>, attended by almost five hundred people- the conference was full of talks, workshops, barcamps and hackathons, too! The group's main goals for 2015 are to keep sharing data driven journalism knowledge in through offline events like datafests, hackathons, barecamps, data expeditions and workshops in more cities, to launch an online presence, and to prepare their first MOOC.</p>

          <h3>ESCOLA DE DADOS</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Throughout the start of the year, our Brazilian partners in crime, <a href="http://escoladedados.org/"> Escola de Dados </a>, led by the Brazilian chapter of Open Knowldege, <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/programadedados2014_01>held online and offline study groups </a>, to teach people how to programme following edX’s Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python. </P>

    <p> They partnered up with Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA) and Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) to offer a 30-hour-5-day-hands-on Introduction to Data Journalism course, benefitting 55 students from 12 different cities in Brazil. And it's not even over yet. The same 30-hour course that took place in the cities of Salvador and Rio de Janeiro will also happen in São Paulo between February and March 2015. For Portuguese readers, there’s lots more about this on <a href="http://escoladedados.org/blog/">their blog.</a></p>

          <h3>SCHOOL OF DATA</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>

           <p> At the end of 2013, the group in Greece teamed up with the Media Informatics Lab of School of Journalism & Mass Communication, and the Master of Web Science of School of Mathematics of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, to translate <a href="http://datajournalism.okfn.gr/">the Data Journalism Handbook into Greek</a>.
          </p>

          <p> After all this prep work, they were ready in 2014 to lauch the local version of <a href="http://schoolofdata.okfn.gr/"> School of Data </a> with a bunch of materials translated into Greek. They also ran their first <a href="http://okfncommunity.tumblr.com/post/85295539575/greek-data-expedition-and-data-journalism">data expedition</a> creating articles based on data and some great infographics. From Spring semester 2015, a new undergraduate course on "Data Journalism" will be running, too- look out for updates on <a href="http://schoolofdata.okfn.gr/blog/">their blog</a>!</p>

 			<p>Our group in France have localised a version of the School of Data site, with translation into French and set up of the <a href="http://ecoledesdonnees.org/handbook/cours/">Ecole des Données site</a> together with translation of some of the basic online courses into French. This year, they also held a public data expedition on the subject of Air pollution in Paris urban area, and we were very happy to see members of the group at our Summer Camp in 2014.</p>
