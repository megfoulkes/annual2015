            <p>This year, we also  seconded the newest member of the Open Knowledge School of Data team, Sam Leon, to spend some quality time working with Global Witness, one of the world’s leading anti-corruption NGOs, on a series of data-driven investigations and simultaneously to build their core data skills.  Sam’s ‘embedded fellowship’ started in February 2014, and together they delivered some incredible, data-driven outputs like <a href=”https://www.globalwitness.org/deadlyenvironment/”>this interactive infographic</a> on the sharp rise of deaths of environmental defenders, and <a href=”http://greatripoffmap.globalwitness.org/”>The Great Rip Off</a> site to accompany Global Witness’ campaign against anonymous company ownership, together with developers from J++.</p><br>
            <p>This represents our first big organisational-level capacity building programme and we are very grateful to Global Witness for being such wonderful, open-minded hosts and partners.

              <p><strong>"It’s transformed the way we work, it’s made us think differently how we communicate information: how we make it more accessible, visual and exciting. It’s really changed the way we do things."</strong><br><em>Brendan O'Donnell, <br>Senior Campaigner at Global Witness</em></p>
