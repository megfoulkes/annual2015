            <p>In January, we <a href=”http://schoolofdata.org/2014/02/04/introducing-the-open-development-toolkit/”>launched our first shared project</a>, together with <a href=”http://devinit.org”>Development Initiatives</a>: the Open Development Toolkit. This was our first foray into topic-specific data, in this case, looking at data around aid, and trying to encourage potential data users to actually use the vast amounts of data made available on the topic.

            <p>Data availability is not the same as data accessibility. Overwhelmingly, though not always, international development organisations are making tools and portals without considering the needs of data users. So, we created an Aid Data curriculum focused on meeting those needs, thinking specifically about information intermediaries in aid-recipient countries. We put the modules online and sent them to our community, and we tested out these modules offline in trainings with School of Data fellows. We also created a <a href=”http://opendevtoolkit.net”>community-focused online hub</a>, curating news, data portals, reviews and walkthroughs of how to use them.</p>
