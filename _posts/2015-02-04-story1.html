<p>After nearly 3 years of growth and shared successes, the time has come to formally recognise the growing array of School of Data partners and stakeholders and share ownership and decision making of School of Data with them.</p>

<p><strong>In 2015 we have successfully started the journey towards transitioning the ownership of the School of Data by establishing a governance structure.</strong><span> After intensive meetings, debates and voting during our last <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2015/06/05/what-does-a-school-of-data-summer-camp-look-like/">Summer Camp in Ottawa</a>, the School of Data members elected a Steering Group and empowered them to represent the entire network, manage shared assets like the School of Data brand and fundraise for the network going forward. Our newly elected Steering Committee members are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Natalia Mazotte, Programme Manager of School of Data Brazil</li>
	<li>Bardhyl Jashari, Director of Metamorphosis, Macedonia</li>
	<li>Sander van der Waal, Projects Director at Open Knowledge International</li>
	<li>Antonio Cucho Gamboa, Senior School of Data fellow and Open Data Activist in Peru</li>
	<li>Juan Manuel Casanueva, Director of Social TIC</li>
</ul>
