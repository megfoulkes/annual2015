							There were always the potential for School of Data to reach out to communities through open and massive online courses. This past year proved that we can make a difference when we partner up with organisations such as Small Media and the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas.
						</p>
						<p>
							With Small Media, School of Data produced two introductory courses, one about Data Gathering and the other about Data Analysis &amp; Cleaning. Quickly our two courses, available in English, Farsi and Arabic, were amongst the most watched at Advocacy Assembly, the open e-learning platform managed by Small Media.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two School of Data Brazil instructors organised and produced the first massive and open Data Journalism course 100% in Portuguese, for the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, using School of Data's Data Pipeline methodology. The course was sponsored by the Brazilian Association of Newspapers with support from Google. The experience was a staggering success: 5000 participants and a plethora of data driven stories published using the techniques learned during the course.
						</p>
						<p>
							School of Data is working with both Small Media and the Knight Center to produce more courses in 2016.
