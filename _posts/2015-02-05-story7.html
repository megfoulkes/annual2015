							School of Data received the support of the World Bank and the Philippine Centre for Investigative Journalism to run a 6-month data-journalism training program with journalists from 12 media organisations in the Philippines. The activites were lead by Senior Fellow Sam Leon, who organised a 2-day in person workshop in July and a series of remote sessions after that to support teams on their data investigations. The programme was wrapped up late November, with more than 100 people attending the ending event.

								<strong>“Data Journalism PH 2015 is a workshop every serious journalist should take. More than teaching me practical skills - how to create maps, infographics, and spreadsheets - it made me realize how important it is to use hard facts, as opposed to merely relying on statements, to create a public that is more informed and more critical”</strong><br>
