            <p>One of our main aims at School of Data is to encourage people to use and work with data - and this series of events helped us think through how we, and the wider community, can do so in a responsible way. We joined <a href="http://theengineroom.org/">the engine room</a> in their Responsible Data Forum series of events as an agenda partner, to help develop tools and strategies to deal with the ethical, security and privacy challenges facing data-driven advocacy.<p>

            <p>Our work within this series of events included joining the kick-off event in Oakland, collaborating on the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/forums/responsible-resource-sprint/">Resource Sprint in Budapest</a>, and taking part in a booksprint to produce <a href="http://tiny.cc/rddevbook">a book on Responsible Data in global development</a>. All of the resources produced through the event series are <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">available online</a>, and the series is ongoing. It was a great opportunity to work with some brilliant organisations and bring together our collective experience to face these new challenges!</p>
