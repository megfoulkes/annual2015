##School of Data Report, 2015

This is the second iteration of our annual report, built on top of the wonderful work led by Zara Rahman and others in 2014.

With big thanks to the team at Code for America for designing such a beautiful report template, making their code open source and easy to follow - this is all forked from the [Code for America Annual Report](http://2013.codeforamerica.org) and inspired by the [Code for Germany 2014 Annual report.](http://2014.codefor.de/#)
